# Face-Att
The "Contactless Face Recognition Attendance System" is a project designed to automate the attendance tracking process in various settings, such as schools, businesses, or organizations, by utilizing facial recognition technology. This system is implemented using a combination of frontend and backend technologies, making it a comprehensive solution for managing attendance records. It offers an innovative and efficient way to manage attendance through the integration of facial recognition technology and a well-designed frontend interface, combined with a robust backend infrastructure. This system has the potential to streamline attendance management processes in various settings.

Frontend:
1. HTML and CSS: The project's frontend is developed using HTML for creating the web interface and CSS for styling. This user-friendly interface allows users to interact with the system easily.

2. Python Tkinter: Python Tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the system. Users can initiate attendance tracking and access attendance reports through this interface.

Backend:
1. MySQL Workbench: The backend of the system relies on MySQL Workbench, which is a popular relational database management system. It is used to store and manage attendance records efficiently. Data related to students or employees, such as names and unique identification numbers, are stored in this database.

2. PHP: PHP is used for server-side scripting to facilitate communication between the frontend and the database. It processes user requests, such as marking attendance, retrieving data, and generating attendance reports.
